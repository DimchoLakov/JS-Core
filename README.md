JavaScript is one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world of web technologies. Whether you want to write client applications or server code, the JavaScript Core module will introduce you to the basics of language and specific functional programming conferences, working with the DOM browser tree, and sending HTTP queries to a REST service. 

The module consists of three courses: JS Fundamentals, JS Advanced and JS Applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JavaScript Fundamentals course builds basic programming skills with JavaScript. JavaScript constructs for programming logic, data types, operators, expressions, conditional constructs, cycles, and function handling are studied. Attention is drawn to work with arrays, strings and regular expressions, use of objects, associative arrays and sets. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (ES2017 is studied).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JavaScript Advanced course extends the skills gained in the JavaScript Fundamentals course with more sophisticated concepts and principles of Functional Programming (FP) and Object-Oriented Programming (PLO) with JavaScript, as well as using DOM to process elements in a web page. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (modern JavaScript is studied with ES2017).

The course starts by studying the JavaScript object object (DOM and BOM) and interacting with it from JavaScript: searching, editing and deleting DOM tree elements, event processing, interaction with the web browser.

In-depth study of functions and paradigms from functional programming (FP): function as object, functional expressions, higher order functions, IIFE, JS object and JSON operation, object composition, higher order functions, closure, JS templates such as revealing module, prototype object inheritance and prototype chain, work with generators and iterators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JavaScript Applications course (JS Apps) develops practical skills for building front-end applications with JavaScript, jQuery, ReactJS, AJAX and REST services. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (ES2017 is used).

Studying HTTP, REST and jQuery AJAX and accessing REST services with AJAX queries. JavaScript and REST-based client applications are built to retrieve and visualize data from public REST APIs such as GitHub API, TheMovieDb API, and CRUD through REST authentication service. Consideration is also being given to building backend REST services on cloud-based backend-as-a-service / BaaS.

The principles of asynchronous JavaScript programming with promises, async / await and Web workers, as well as Web storage (cookies, session and local storage) and the use of help libraries, tools and technologies such as Babel transpiler, Grunt and Gulp, ESLint , lodash, sammy, and others.
